The Soviet-German alliance before the June 21, 1941 is essentially a matter of 'fact' undisputed by any serious modern sources.\nFirst of all, they have concluded an agreement about occupying 3rd countries not disputed by any sources.\nSecond, they actually occupied these countries, as was agreed also undisputed.\nBack to the original comment by Ohiostandrd.\nThere is no any discussion at article talk page.\nOne minor suggestion would be to replace words 'Structures in the PDB containing this domain' by 'Proteins in the PDB containing this domain' in the output of the query, because it shows other domains.\nThere is one minor misconception because this query shows structures with other domains.\nI am using PDBsum-Pfam queries right now, but there are some minor issues with PDB-Pfam mapping which is not a PDBsum problem.\nTaking lipases as an example, it seems that PDB structures 1ku0,\nI also think it would be a good idea to look more carefully at the differences in Pfam and SCOP classifications.\nWhile I agree that family of fungal lipases in SCOP should be split, as it is in the current release of Pfam, this is more questionable for bacterial lipases e.g. placing LIP BURCE and ESTA BACSU to different families, PF01674 and PF00561.\nPF00561 looks like a dump for alpha/beta hydrolases that were not assigned to other families.\nOther than that, having these queries is a huge asset!\nSearching pills by color is wrong because each of them can be provided in a variety of different colors.\nThis is very different from an image of person, molecule or animal.\nBesides, placing large images of pills like here is ugly.\nPlacing images of pills in drugboxes is nonsense.\nThis has no information content whatsoever.\nThis could be a chemical structure of the drug, a graph showing sales of the drug,\nThat's why PDBsum people must clearly mark theoretical models as theoretical models in outputs of their queries.
