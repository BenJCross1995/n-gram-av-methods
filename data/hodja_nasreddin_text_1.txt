If they actually censor anything is another question.\nUnlike others, Medvedev is an internationally recognized historian.\nHe tells that these people are governmental bureaucrats although some of them have degrees.\nMain point this is a Can anyone clarify, please, where the 21 million number for three countries in version 3 comes from?\nI hope you do not suggest to replace three large sections about Kirov assassination by his single paragraph?\nOf course, if there is any sourced information in his text that currently missing, it might be 'added' to current version.\nPerhaps this article should be merged, but this must be properly done.\nYes, that was one of the reasons why she left big sport so early.\nOf course he did not write about his abuse in reports to KGB superiors.\nI like book by Radzinsky, but this source provides much more details with a lot of references Radzinsky works on a bigger 3-volume biography of Stalin right now.\nSo, you are very welcome to improve this and 'other' articles on the subject using this book.\nJust remember to focus on content, not contributors.\nUnfortunately, this is not what sources tell as was already discussed above.\nHigher estimates include not only mass murders or executions but also avoidable lives lost due to famine and disease due to confiscation or destruction of property, in addition to deaths in forced labor camps or during forced relocation.\nThe number also does not include civilians executed during Russian civil war, etc.\nUnfortunately I do not have time right now, but I will check some sources that describe repression of children in the Soviet Union to make changes in relevant articles accordingly - as time allows.\nJust wanted to tell you about this case.\nThe grandson of Stalin went to court against the radio because the remark was a slander.\nThe radio's lawyer and editor in chef didn't manage to prove in court that children were executed in USSR, simply because there was no proof.\nI hope you reconsider your position in the light of this info.
